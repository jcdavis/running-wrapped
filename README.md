# Running Wrapped

An attempt at visualizing all my runs in 2025.

The data here is all pulled from intervals.icu. `python3 download_activities.py <api_token>` to download all the activities and there data streams into the `/data` directory, then `process_activities.py` to generate the singular `processed_activities.json` which is used by the app
